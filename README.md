- I'm singin' in the rain
- Just singin' in the rain
- What a glorious feeling
- I'm happy again
- I'm laughin' at clouds
- So dark up above
- The sun's in my heart
- And I'm ready for love
- Let the stormy clouds chase
- Everyone from the place
- Come on with the rain
- I've a smile on my face
- I'll walk down the lane
- With a happy refrain
- Just singin'
- Singin' in the rain
- Dancin' in the rain
- Da da da da da da
- I'm happy again
- I'm singin' and dancin' in the rain
- I'm dancin' and singin' in the rain
